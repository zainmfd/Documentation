 Step 3 :-  
 **Cloning a repository**, When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations.  
 You can clone a repository from GitHub to your local computer to make it easier to fix merge conflicts, add or remove files, and push larger commits. When you clone a repository, you copy the repository from GitHub to your local machine.  

Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project. You can push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub, or pull other people's changes from GitHub.

For cloning right click on where ever you want to get your local copy into your PC and click on git bash.  
then enter a comment like shown below.

**zainmfd** is my user name and **Documentation** is repository name.
